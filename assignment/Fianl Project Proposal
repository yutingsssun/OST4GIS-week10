### User experience
At a high level, how do you expect people to use your application?
- Who are the users?
  Transportation planners, passengers in Northeast Corridor
- What do they gain from your application' use?
  The route information. how much does it cost? How long it will take?
  The major transit hub's information
  The potential transit hub
- Are there any website/application examples in the wild to which you can compare your final?
